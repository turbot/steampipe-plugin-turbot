CLI
* Use SQL limit qual to restrict searching too far
* Filtering with an optional qualifier needs to work with caching etc

PLUGIN
* Config from steampipe config, default to terraform flow
* Update timestamp as nil ... how do we handle this? (Particularly for the resource table.)
* Dynamically build GraphQL based on columns requested, optimizing the backend queries
* Cleanup all log Warn level stuff

QUESTIONS
* Do we do separate turbot_resource vs turbot_resource_filter tables?
